# SharondaWith over 12 years of experience as a Level 2 and 3 security professional, I have built a strong foundation in physical security, threat response, and safety protocols. Throughout my career, I’ve developed a deep appreciation for the importance of protecting people, organizations, and sensitive information from both internal and external threats. 
Now, I am actively transitioning into the field of cybersecurity, where I aim to apply my knowledge of physical security principles to the digital realm.
I bring strong writing skills and a proven ability to collaborate effectively on team-based projects. 
I’m currently working to enhance my analytical and verbal communication skills to better align with the demands of cyber defense and incident response roles. 
I am driven by a genuine commitment to security in all its forms and eager to contribute to the growing need for cybersecurity professionals who understand both physical and digital threat landscapes.
